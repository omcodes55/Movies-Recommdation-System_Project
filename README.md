ðŸŽ¥ Content-Based Movie Recommendation System Using Machine Learning â€“ My Project Update!

Iâ€™m happy to share my latest project â€” a Content-Based Movie Recommender System built using Python, Machine Learning techniques, and Streamlit!

ðŸ§  How it works:
The system suggests similar movies based on the content of the selected movie (like genres, overview, etc.). It uses cosine similarity, a machine learning technique, to compare movie features and recommend the top 5 closest matches.

ðŸ”§ Tech Used:
Python & Pandas for data handling
Machine Learning (Cosine Similarity + Feature Extraction)
Pickle for loading preprocessed data
Streamlit for building a clean, interactive web app

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:
Simple UI: Just pick a movie, click recommend, and get results
Fast performance with preloaded data
Real-time suggestions for a better user experience
This was a fun and educational project that helped me understand how machine learning powers recommendation systems behind the scenes.

ðŸ“Œ Open to feedback and collaboration!
